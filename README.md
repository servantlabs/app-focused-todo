This is my idea for a to do app. Instead of being distracted by all that needs to be done, the primary usage of this app is to "focus" on one item at a time. Each item will have a button to click to make it the “focus” item, and it will fill the entire screen with just that item until it is marked complete. 

Built on Netlify with a nextjs package. 

Some further enhancements could include a timer, either to track time or to do a pomodoro session.
